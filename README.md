## pseudo code or explaination

step1.
Generate Keypair Using bip_utils:

Bip39MnemonicGenerator: Generates a 12-word mnemonic.
Bip39SeedGenerator: Generates a seed from the mnemonic.
Bip44: Derives the account using BIP44 path for Solana.
Extracts the private and public keys from the derived account.
Set Up Solana Client:

step2.
Initializes a Solana client connected to the devnet.
Prepare Token Transfer Details:

step3.
Define recipient's address, token mint address, source, and destination token accounts.
Fetch the recent blockhash for the transaction.
Create and Sign the Transaction:

step4.
Creates a transfer instruction using the token program.
Builds and signs the transaction with the generated keypair.
Send the Transaction:

step5.
Sends the signed transaction to the Solana network.


Notes:
Replace placeholder values like 
RecipientPublicKeyHere, 
TokenMintAddressHere, 
SourceTokenAccountAddressHere, and 
DestinationTokenAccountAddressHere with actual values.
Ensure you securely handle and store the mnemonic and private keys for production use
